# xml2keen 

This is everything you need to send XML data to http://keen.io for your analytics reporting.

Simply pull this repo, run "npm install" in the command line, then "node server".

From there use your favorite REST Client, I like: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-rest-client/hgmloofddffdnphfgcellkdfbfbjeloo?hl=en-US

Do a POST request to http://localhost:3000 with XML data in the body, you'll see the JSON response in the REST client and in your console.

Next go to line 49 and 50 of server.js and enter in your ProjectID and API writekey.

Next go to http://heroku.com and sign up for a free account, then follow their instructions for pushing your code to an account with them.

Now you can send XML data to Keen.io :)
